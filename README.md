# Advent of Code 2022

This project contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2022.

## Usage
Build the project with Go: 
    - `cd aoc && go build ./...`
Run the binaries available in: `$GOPATH/bin`:

**Note**: The binaries depend on an AOC provided session ID which can be found in the browser's `session` cookie after logging in.
    - `AOC_SESSION_ID="" ./day-<number>` # This prints the solution to stdout. Copypasta to your AOC and submit.
